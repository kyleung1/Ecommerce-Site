Ecommerce Site

9/15/2022

The function of this project was to mimic a basic ecommerce site that allows users to log in, add items to cart and check out. This project uses the mern(Mongodb, Express, React, Nodejs) stack. 

Some challenges I encountered were trying to learn how asynchronous functions worked and making a dropdown menu, I will need to revisit this project in the future as I still have not figured out how to implement them.

The purpose of this project was to learn how to put together a full stack website.
